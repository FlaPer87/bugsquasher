#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Portable shell scripting is hard, let's go shopping.
#
# People insist on aliasing commands like 'cd', either with a real
# alias or even a shell function. Under bash and zsh, "builtin" forces
# the use of a command that is part of the shell itself instead of an
# alias, function, or external command, while "command" does something
# similar but allows external commands. Under ksh "builtin" registers
# a new command from a shared library, but "command" will pick up
# existing builtin commands. We need to use a builtin for cd because
# we are trying to change the state of the current shell, so we use
# "builtin" for bash and zsh but "command" under ksh.
#
# Name wasn't changed on purpose, next function was taken from virtualenvwrapper.
